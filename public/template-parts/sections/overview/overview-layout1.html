In order to help the team with sales efforts and conduct a more thorough market analysis, it was decided to build a website. It was clear what to do once we learned that they handle more than 100 leads each month.</p>

                        <p class="txt">It was time for us to tap into our inner child to kick-start BocahKecil's rejuvenation. The logo was the only thing we were certain would not change. So our designer made the decision to become familiar with it.</p>
