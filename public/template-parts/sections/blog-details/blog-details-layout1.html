                        <p class="details-txt-1">Pinterest has a huge potential for advertisers with over 1.7 million monthly reaches in Switzerland, but marketers in our nation are still not fully utilizing it. Businesses that use the platform as part of their digital marketing strategy are still rare. Because there is less competition for advertising space on Pinterest than on other social platforms, it has an impressive Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), making it an effective and affordable tool for many different types of digital marketing strategies.</p>

                        <p class="details-txt-1">With over 60% of its users being female, Pinterest is especially appealing for targeting female demographics in addition to its ROAS performance. With a 50% increase in generation Z users over the previous year and a 36% increase in generation Y users, Pinterest is another important channel for marketing to millennial and digital native consumers. However, Pinterest is more generally positioning itself as a major player on the social media scene, and its relevance to the digital campaign strategies of various types of businesses should be carefully considered. Over the past year, the number of male users has increased by 48%.</p>
