Another goal was to make this website as<br> mobile-friendly as possible so that parents who<br> are on the go can quickly browse the available,<br> daycares and make reservations with ease.</p>
                        <p class="txt1">We added a feature that allows users to schedule<br> appointments online to visit the daycare or meet<br> the nanny.</p>

By ensuring that the business can contact its clients, this will also help with client retention.</p>
                        <p class="txt1">Additionally, adding a live chat feature enhances the website's ability to establish direct contact, improving user experience.</p>
